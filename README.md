# deep-learning-image-classification

Uses TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Obtains 67% accuracy with a simple CNN.

The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. As described in the Jupyter notebook, I normalized and one-hot encoded the images, and then trained a CNN on them. I also used max pooling layers and dropout to improve the neural network's accuracy.
